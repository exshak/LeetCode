# Given two sorted integer arrays nums1 and nums2, merge nums2 into nums1 as
# one sorted array.
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# The number of elements initialized in nums1 and nums2 are m and n
# respectively.
# You may assume that nums1 has enough space (size that is greater or equal to
# m + n) to hold additional elements from nums2.
# 
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Input:
# nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3
# nums2 = [2,5,6],       n = 3
# 
# Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
