# Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new list. The new list
# should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

# @lc code=start
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def mergeTwoLists(self, l1: ListNode, l2: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        
# @lc code=end
