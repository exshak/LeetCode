# Testcase Example:  '[2,3,-2,4]'
#
# Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray within an array
# (containing at least one number) which has the largest product.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: [2,3,-2,4]
# Output: 6
# Explanation: [2,3] has the largest product 6.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: [-2,0,-1]
# Output: 0
# Explanation: The result cannot be 2, because [-2,-1] is not a subarray.
